# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input("Enter the number of men who stepped on the moon: ")
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

## Output
Enter the number of men who stepped on the moon: Twelve
Twelve
```
## Result
Hence the string is read and the value is printed.
